This script receives telemetry information as packets sent from the F1 2013 game and parses the rev count, lap time, and
position. It then will control LED's and six-segment displays based on this information.
Green LEDs for lean revs, red for standard, and blue for full. These LEDs will be on a Raspberry Pi IO breadboard.
